# SolveKami

Kami is a puzzle game on iOS and Android. It's not free. The SolveKami is a simple algorithm to solve it.

Now it can only solve a small part of Kami.


## Make

```shell
$ make
```

		
## Input File

```solveKami.in``` is a sample for input file.

As SolveKami is stupid now, you'd better write your inputfile carefully.


## Run

This is an example:
```shell
$ solveKami < solveKami.in
```

## TODO
1. Show the algorithm used;
2. Explain the data structures.
